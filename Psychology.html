            Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.
            Although the terms are often used interchangeably, poor mental health and mental illness are not the same. A person can experience poor mental health and not be diagnosed with a mental illness. Likewise, a person diagnosed with a mental illness can experience periods of physical, mental, and social well-being.

        <p>There is no single cause for mental illness. A number of factors can contribute to risk for mental illness, such as</p>
        <p>
            Early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse (for example, child abuse, sexual assault, witnessing violence, etc.) <br>
            Experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes <br>
            Use of alcohol or drugs<br>
            Having feelings of loneliness or isolation<br>
           </p>

       <li> Types</li>
       <p>
       <b>Depression</b> is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease your ability to function at work and at home. <br>
       <b>Panic disorder</b>  is an anxiety disorder where you regularly have sudden attacks of panic or fear. Everyone experiences feelings of anxiety and panic at certain times. It's a natural response to stressful or dangerous situations.<br>
      <b>Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</b> is a disorder that develops in some people who have experienced a shocking, scary, or dangerous event. It is natural to feel afraid during and after a traumatic situation. Fear triggers many split-second changes in the body to help defend against danger or to avoid it.<br>
      <b> Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)</b>is a common mental health condition where a person has obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours. OCD can affect men, women and children. Some people start having symptoms early, often around puberty, but it usually starts during early adulthood.<br>
      <b> Eating disorders</b>are a range of psychological conditions that cause unhealthy eating habits to develop. They might start with an obsession with food, body weight, or body shape.
      In severe cases, eating disorders can cause serious health consequences and may even result in death if left untreated. In fact, eating disorders are among the deadliest mental illnesses, second to opioid overdose.

            <h2>Why is mental health important for overall health?</h2>
            <ul>
                
                <p>Mental and physical health are equally important components of overall health.  For example, depression increases the risk for many types of physical health problems, particularly long-lasting conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Similarly, the presence of chronic conditions can increase the risk for mental illness.</p>

            <h2>How common are mental illnesses?</h2>

                <h2>Why Should We Spread Mental Health Awareness?</h2>
                <p>
                    Having those tough conversations and admitting there's a problem means we can come up with a solution. We can start removing the shame and fear that's often associated with topics surrounding mental health. Doing so can increase the likelihood of someone reaching out when they need help. 
                    Asking for help is a sign of strength. Working together allows us to begin building a foundation that respects and honors the importance of good mental health.
