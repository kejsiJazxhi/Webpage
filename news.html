        <p> <b>Loma Linda University Health </b>has done a video for all people that suffer from depression. 
           <br> You are not alone in this. Watch the video and understand more about how you feel.
          <br> <b>Comments</b> <br>
          <i class="fa-solid fa-play"></i>One of the ways to overcome depression is to try sensitize people who don't know what it really means. This means talking about your experience and helping other people take their mental health seriously. You can still impact your world positively.
     <br> <i class="fa-solid fa-play"></i>I suffered from sever depression about 25 years ago and it really affected my GPA in college as I didn't care about anything and my GPA was not a concern as I didn't even think that my life was worth living. I have recovered from that depression thankfully within a year. I think depression comes from loneliness and not having the things that bring you joy in life. Having an active social life in my opinion is important to beat depression, unfortunately not everyone have people who care about them and who would do anything for them to get them through depression. My advice is to try anything that would bring you joy or a sense of purpose, even if it is cleaning a room or rearranging something that gives you a sense of accomplishment can help. Try finding anything that would bring you joy and just do it, I have another suggestion is go out and take a walk, it helps.
