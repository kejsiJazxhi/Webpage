            A therapeutic consultant is typically a licensed or otherwise credentialed professional who is skilled in dealing with therapeutic issues. 
            They also understand the complex nature of problems related to mental health, addiction, behavioral problems, learning differences and a variety of other issues that teens, young adults and even older adults often experience. Consultants possess an extensive knowledge of resources around the country that work with those suffering from many types of challenges. In other words, a therapeutic consultant is a professional who can guide you and offer valuable direction. These services ensure that an individual’s needs are matched to the right type of help, increasing the chance of a successful outcome for your loved one.

        <h2>The Origins Of Consultants</h2>
        <img class="img" src="image/kind5.jpg">
        <div class="text">
           
            <p> The role of therapeutic consultants has roots in our educational system. Educational consultants originally existed to help place young people in college preparatory schools, traditional boarding schools and institutions of higher learning.
                 This role gave way to other types of consultants, including those who now work more in behavioral health and addiction treatment.<br>
                 Today, therapeutic consultants, interventionists and many other types of referring professionals work with families and individuals to help them find the most effective care and support to meet their individual needs.
            </p>
            <img class="img" src="image/kind7.jpg">
            <p>Therapeutic consultants are focused on the clinical and therapeutic aspects of the challenges someone may be facing and typically are familiar with programs such as psychiatric hospitals, residential treatment centers, wilderness or outdoor therapy programs, therapeutic boarding schools, recovery support services and young adult transition programs, as well as many other resources that provide behavioral health treatment and other therapeutic support.  </p>

        <h2>What Does A Therapeutic Consultant Do?</h2>
        <ul>
            <img class="cont-img" src="image/kind1.jpg">
          <li>To be a guide for families</li>
          <img class="cont-img" src="image/kind2.jpg">
          <p>Consultants spend time regularly visiting programs, collaborating with other treatment professionals and learning about the most effective treatment protocols available to treat a wide variety of different mental health issues.
            A skilled therapeutic consultant or referring professional will have an in-depth knowledge of the many programs, facilities and services that are available to assist families. They will get to know their client's individual challenges, the overall family dynamics and which services or supports are going to best help the individual and family move forward on a more positive path.</p>
            <li>To help them understand the nature of the presenting problems through review and interpretation of any psychological testing or other assessments.</li>
            <p> In short, therapeutic consultants work with clients to find solutions for the problems they are facing.
          In a field as complex and overwhelming as behavioral health and addiction treatment, having an experienced consultant lead the way is invaluable. We can refer you to the top resources across the country and help you avoid the many pitfalls that families often face when they are trying to navigate these challenges on their own. Consultants will help you research programs, find the best possible treatment options and support you through a therapeutic placement process, managing any crisis along the way and making sure you do everything possible to have a good outcome.
           </p>
        <li>To conduct their own evaluations when necessary and to coordinate and consult with other treatment providers to develop a plan that will address an individual's needs.</li>

            <h2>Independent And Objective</h2>
            <p>
                Therapeutic consultants are independent and should receive no compensation from programs or schools. 
                They are only paid by the families they are working with, and thus are not clouded by conflicts of interest. 
                Clients can be sure that they are being given advice based solely on an objective assessment of their needs - not because a consultant is being paid by a third-party for a referral. A consultant's impartiality fosters trust from clients and ensures that the recommendations being made are based solely on what services are going to provide the best possible chance of success and recovery for an individual and family.

                <h2>Doctors</h2>
                <p>Any family suffering with mental health issues, substance use disorders or other behavioral health problems can benefit from the guidance and support of a therapeutic consultant. The more serious these conditions are, the more important it may be for you to seek the services of a consultant.
