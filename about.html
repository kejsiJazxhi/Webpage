  </div>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Overview</h2>

  <p style="text-align: center; padding: 15px; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px; line-height: 1.5;">
    We are a community of experienced psychotherapists,
    counsellors and coaches providing talking therapies to
    individuals, couples and families. Our team has been carefully curated and is composed of some of the top
    therapists. The various personalities and expertise areas on our team allow us to treat individuals, couples
    and families, with a wide variety of presenting problems. Whether you are seeking therapy for general mental
    health
    or to address a specific concern or psychological disorder, we will tailor treatment to meet your needs.

    What makes Mindset Therapy particularly unique is our client-therapist matching process where we aim to
    relieve the initial hardship of shopping around to find the right therapist. After a brief initial screening, the
    director of our practice, Dr. Louis Towey, will match you with a therapist based on your personality, specific
    goals, availability, and financial circumstances. There are no matching algorithms here; Dr. towey knows each
    clinician on our team very well and uses her knowledge to thoughtfully pair clients and therapists. This typically
    results in a genuine, fulfilling and secure relationship with your therapist that facilitates and bolsters the
    therapy process. </p>


  <h2 style="text-align: center;">History</h2>
  <p style="text-align: center; padding: 15px; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;"> The Mindset Psychotherapy
    was organized in 1980 in order to provide high quality therapy at an affordable cost. For over 40 years we have been
    offering our patients treatment in our private practice settings. Many of us offer services that are free of managed
    care restrictions and, therefore, ensure greater privacy and confidentiality.

  <ul style="text-align: left; padding: 15px; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px; line-height: 1.5;">
    <li>In 1983, Mindset establishes its own credential, The National Board for Certified Counselors (NBCC).</li>
    <li>By the mid 1980s, it has become obvious that, if mental health counselors were to work in the health care
      system, new and more rigorous standards were going to have to be established.</li>
    <li>The 1986-1987 AMHCA Board of Directors adopts a set of comprehensive training standards for mental health
      counselors: 60 semester credit hours and a minimum of 1,000 clock hours of clinical supervision.</li>
    <li>In 1992, Counseling is included as a primary mental health profession in the health care human resource
      statistics of the Center for Mental Health Services and the National Institute of Mental Health.</li>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Achievments</h2>
  <p style="text-align: center; padding: 15px; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">It is impossible in a mere
    chapter to discuss all of the achievements of the thousands of studies and decades of psychotherapy research that
    are now part of our history. As a consequence, I shall focus on those achievements that exerted the greatest
    relevance to practice and training. This focus is consistent with the major goals of psychotherapy research as an
    applied clinical science, namely, protecting and promoting the welfare of the client by identifying the principles
    and procedures that enhance positive outcomes. The research achievements are divided into two major categories: (a)
    those that have been attained directly in response to the goals of research and (b) those that are conceptual and
    methodological by-products of the research itself. Such a classification allows us to see how successful we have
    been in answering many of the questions we have asked and, at the same time, to examine the fortunate consequences
    of undertaking research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)</p>
