                    Therapy at Mindset has been a really positive and transformative experience. The therapist got what
                    I needed straight away and through incisive but gentle questioning helped me change the way I think
                    about so many things. If you are thinking about talking to a therapist, I would encourage you to go
                    for it!</p>

                        me. Mindet helped me regain control of my life by coming to terms with the past, forgiving
                        myself and others, reconnect with myself, overcome my sense of helplessness, appreciate myself
                        more
                        and gain strength and confidence to walk away from the toxic relationship I was in. Overall,
                        Mindest turned my life around and I will be forever grateful for all of her help.</p>

                    <p class="review">I came across Mindet when I was going through a rough patch and needed someone to
                        help and listen. Psychotherapists were phenomenal from the first meeting, always attentive,
                        never judgmental and helped me with coping strategies to get me through such a difficult time.
                        Looking back on it now I do not know how I would have got to where I am now without their
                        support
                        and would recommend Mindset to anyone in a similar position.</p>
