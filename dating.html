        <p>
         Whether your dynamic with your partner is impacted by addiction, infidelity, anxiety, or any other issue, you can likely benefit from therapy for relationship issues.
         Even if you're currently single, relationship counseling can be helpful. If you're struggling with finding the right person or just having a hard time with dating overall, consider speaking with a counselor. Therapy for dating can help you gain a stronger sense of your needs and learn about relationships in general.

            <img class="img" src="image/dating3.jpg">
          <li>General Dating & Relationship Issues</li>
          <p>There are many common struggles that people face in their relationships. Having problems does not mean you are bad, or that your relationship is doomed--it just means that you are human.
            It's important to note that while these are common issues for people who are dating or in relationships, they don't need to be problems forever. By processing these problems with a relationship and dating issues therapist, you can reduce or even eliminate their impact on your love life.</p>
          <li>Addiction</li>
          <p>In relationship counseling, you can learn more about addiction itself and process the unique ways that addiction impacts relationships.</p>
           <img class="img" src="image/dating4.jpg">
           <li>Anxiety</li>
           <p>On top of all of the mental and emotional symptoms, people with anxiety often experience physical effects as well. These may include a racing heart, muscle tension, and stomach issues.
            There's no doubt that anxiety can be debilitating--and it presents unique challenges related to dating and relationships as well.
            There's no doubt that anxiety can be debilitating--and it presents unique challenges related to dating and relationships as well.</p>
           <li>Indifelty</li>
           <p>This often looks different from couple to couple, as each person (and partnership) has different boundaries. However, if one member of the relationship feels that a certain line of intimacy has been crossed, that likely constitutes infidelity.
            It doesn't necessarily have to involve physical intimacy with another person—emotional infidelity can be just as hurtful. 
            Just as infidelity can take on various forms depending on the relationship, it can have different causes as well. Relationship issues therapy can help you identify and explore these reasons.</p>

            <h2>Therapy for Dating, Even if You Are Not in A Relationship</h2>
            <p>
            You don't necessarily need to be in a relationship to have relationship issues.<br>
             Dating is hard. It can feel defeating when things just never seem to work out with potential partners. You may start to wonder whether you'll ever find someone, and maybe even start questioning your worth.<br>
             However, I'm here to remind you that you're not broken. And with the support of a professional, you can gain insight around your dating habits.<br>
             In therapy, we will explore what's worked for you in past relationships--no matter how small. Together, we'll strategize around building on those strengths and applying them to new partnerships.<br>
             We can also discuss elements of a healthy relationship, communication styles, and other topics that will help you feel more equipped to successfully navigate the dating world.<br>
             Relationship issues therapy can also help improve your dating prospects because it gives you the space to get to know yourself. Reflecting on your personality, needs, and love language will help you get a stronger sense of identity, which can bring a sense of clarity to your dating life.<br>

            <li>How is Therapy for Dating & Relationship Issues Different from Talking to a Friend?</li>
            <p>It's a common misconception that therapy is “just talking.” This limited understanding of counseling often deters couples from getting the help they need. 
             While relationship counseling certainly involves talking, it is much more than that. In therapy, you can process your issues, gain insight into your personal needs, and learn new skills to improve your relationships and dating life. All of this occurs in the context of a safe, confidential, therapeutic space.
             I also bring years of education and experience to our sessions. The support of trusted friends is crucial, but working with a trained professional can help you in a way that friends cannot. </p>
