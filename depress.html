            Depression (also called major depressive disorder or clinical depression) is a common but serious mood disorder. It causes severe symptoms that affect how you feel, think, and handle daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working.
         To be diagnosed with depression, the symptoms must be present for at least two weeks.

            <li>Major depression</li>
            <p>which includes symptoms of depression most of the time for at least 2 weeks that typically interfere with one's ability to work, sleep, study, and eat.</p>
            <li>Persistent depressive disorder</li>
            <p> (also called dysthymia), which often includes less severe symptoms of depression that last much longer, typically for at least 2 years.</p>
           <img class="img" src="image/depr4.jpg">
            <li>Perinatal depression</li>
            <p>which occurs when a woman experiences major depression during pregnancy or after delivery (postpartum depression).</p>
            <li>Seasonal affective disorder</li>
            <p> which comes and goes with the seasons, typically starting in late fall and early winter and going away during spring and summer.
            </p>
            <li>Depression with symptoms of psychosis</li>
            <p>which is a severe form of depression where a person experiences psychosis symptoms, such as delusions (disturbing, false fixed beliefs) or hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that others do not see or hear).</p>

            <ul>
            <img class="cont-img" src="image/depr5.jpg">
            <p>If you have been experiencing some of the following signs and symptoms most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks, you may be suffering from depression:</p>
           <li> Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood</li>
           <li> Feelings of hopelessness, or pessimism</li>
           <li>Feelings of irritability, frustration, or restlessness </li> 
           <li> Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness</li>
            <li>Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities</li>
           <li> Decreased energy, fatigue, or feeling "slowed down"</li>
           
            <li>Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions</li>
           <li> Difficulty sleeping, early morning awakening, or oversleeping</li>
            <li>Changes in appetite or unplanned weight changes</li>
           <li> Thoughts of death or suicide, or suicide attempts</li>
            <li>Aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems without a clear physical cause<br> that do not ease even with treatment</li>
            <img class="cont-img" src="image/depr7.jpg">
           <li> Suicide attempts or thoughts of death or suicide</li>
           <p>Not everyone who is depressed experiences every symptom. Some people experience only a few symptoms while others may experience many.
            Several persistent symptoms in addition to low mood are required for a diagnosis of major depression, but people with only a few -but distressing - symptoms may benefit from treatment as well. The severity and frequency of symptoms and how long they last will vary depending on the individual and his or her particular illness. Symptoms may also vary depending on the stage of the illness.

            <p>
                No two people are affected the same way by depression and there is no "one-size-fits-all" for treatment. It may take some trial and error to find the treatment that works best for you.

                <h2>Things You Can Do</h2>
                <p>
                    Try to get some physical activity. Just 30 minutes a day of walking can boost mood.
                    Try to maintain a regular bedtime and wake-up time.
                    Eat regular, healthy meals.
                    Do what you can as you can. Decide what must get done and what can wait.
                    Try to connect with other people, and talk with people you trust about how you are feeling.
                    Postpone important decisions, such as getting married or divorced, or changing jobs until you feel better.
                    Avoid using alcohol, nicotine, or drugs, including medications not prescribed for you.
